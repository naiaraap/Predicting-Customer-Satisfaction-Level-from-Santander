# Predicting-Customer-Satisfaction-Level-from-Santander

Project available on kaggle platform.

From frontline support teams to C-suites, customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. Unhappy customers don't stick around. What's more, unhappy customers rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving.<br/>
In this competition, I worked with hundreds of anonymized features to predict if a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking experience.
I built a final model using a K-nearest neighbor algorithm with 99% accuracy when applied to the test data provided by kaggle.

The scripts were made in Python, using Pandas, Numpy, scipy and Scikit-Learn frameworks.
The project is documented and presented in the jupyter notebook (CustomerSatisfactionLevelPrediction.ipynb) and in a pdf file (CustomerSatisfactionLevelPrediction.pdf).

Computer specifications:
Operational System: Linux, Ubuntu v.18.04.1
CPU Capacity: 3100MHz.
