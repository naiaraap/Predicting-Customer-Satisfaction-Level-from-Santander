# Predicting-Customer-Satisfaction-Level-from-Santander

Project developed during the course Real-time analysis of Big Data with python and spark, offered by the Data Science Academy.

From frontline support teams to C-suites, customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. Unhappy customers don't stick around. What's more, unhappy customers rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving.
In this competition, I worked with hundreds of anonymized features to predict if a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking experience.

The scripts were made in Python, using Pandas, Numpy and Scikit-Learn frameworks.
